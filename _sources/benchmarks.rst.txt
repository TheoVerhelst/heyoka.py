Benchmarks
==========

See the :ref:`benchmarks section <hy:benchmarks>` in the documentation of the
`heyoka C++ library <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka>`__ for several comparisons
with popular numerical integration packages.

A :ref:`notebook <ensemble_batch_perf>` evaluating the performance of heyoka.py's
batch mode and ensemble parallelisation is also available.
