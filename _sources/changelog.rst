------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~

2.0.0 (2023-09-22)
------------------

New
~~~

- Add model for the circular restricted three-body problem

  is taken by a ``propagate_*()`` function
  (`#128 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/128>`__).
- Introduce several vectorised overloads in the expression
  API. These vectorised overloads allow to perform the same

  classes
  (`#122 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/122>`__).
- Several additions to the :ref:`compiled functions <cfunc_tut>` API:
  compiled functions can now
  be pickled/unpickled, and they expose several information as
  read-only properties (e.g., list of variables, outputs, etc.)
  (`#120 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/120>`__).
- Expressions now support hashing
  (`#120 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/120>`__).
- New ``model`` submodule containing ready-made dynamical models
  (`#119 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/119>`__).

Changes
~~~~~~~

- The custom NumPy memory manager that prevents memory leaks
  with ``real`` arrays is now disabled by default
  (`#129 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/129>`__).

  :ref:`ensemble propagations <ensemble_prop>`
  rather then being shared among threads. The aim of this change
  is to reduce the likelihood of data races
  (`#128 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/128>`__).
- Comprehensive overhaul of the expression system, including:
  enhanced automatic simplification capabilities for sums,
  products and powers, removal of several specialised primitives
  (such as ``square()``, ``neg()``, ``sum_sq()``, etc.),
  re-implementation of division and subtraction as special
  cases of product and sum, and more
  (`#127 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/127>`__).
- heyoka.py now requires at least version 1.0.0 of the
  heyoka C++ library
  (`#127 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/127>`__).

  function in the new ``model`` submodule
  (`#119 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/119>`__).

  ``np.longdouble`` in the heyoka.py API
  (`#99 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/99>`__,
